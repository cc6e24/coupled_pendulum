# coupled_pendulum
This repository is set up within a project for physics concerning coupled pendulums.

Data (in csv format) are named firstly after different lengths of string used (90-110 cm), secondly by the number of trial (1-3) and lastly by the each pendulum (a and b; a is closer to camera and b is further away). The x and y positions are arbitrary and represent only the default settings Tracker generated.
